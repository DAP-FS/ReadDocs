Learning Path
=============

**For Beginner Learners**: Start with :doc:`concepts`, work through basic :doc:`examples`, then practice with guided exercises in :doc:`practice`.

**For Regular Learners**: Review :doc:`concepts` quickly, focus on advanced :doc:`examples`, and challenge yourself with complex problems in :doc:`practice` and :doc:`assessment`.


Getting Started
===============

Regular expressions are fundamental to understanding formal languages and automata theory. They provide a concise way to describe sets of strings and form the foundation for many computational applications.

Start your journey with :doc:`concepts` to build a solid theoretical foundation.
